## Purpose

Engine game definitions carry feature flags so prototype configs can disable behaviors such as tile flipping.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Feature flags on game definition
A game definition SHALL include feature flags that at least support enabling or disabling tile flipping.

#### Scenario: Definition declares flip disabled
- **WHEN** a game definition sets tile flip to false
- **THEN** consumers can read that flag from the definition

### Requirement: Flip respects feature flag
When tile flipping is disabled on the active definition, applying a flip action SHALL leave tile face states unchanged.

#### Scenario: Flip action ignored when disabled
- **WHEN** tile flip is disabled and a flipTile action is applied
- **THEN** the targeted tile's face state is unchanged
